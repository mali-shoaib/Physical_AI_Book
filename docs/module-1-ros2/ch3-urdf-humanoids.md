# Chapter 3: URDF for Humanoids

:::info Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content will be added soon.
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) syntax
- Create humanoid robot models with joints and links
- Add sensors (cameras, IMUs, LiDAR) to robot models
- Use Xacro for modular robot descriptions
- Visualize robots in RViz2

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Chapter 2: rclpy Control](/docs/module-1-ros2/ch2-rclpy-control)
- Basic understanding of 3D coordinate systems
- Familiarity with XML syntax

## Coming Soon

This chapter will cover:

1. URDF Fundamentals: Links and Joints
2. Building a Humanoid Torso
3. Adding Arms and Legs
4. Sensor Integration (RGB-D, IMU, Force Sensors)
5. Xacro Macros for Reusable Components
6. RViz2 Visualization and Debugging
7. Collision and Inertia Properties
