# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Classroom Efficiency Research Paper

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-22
**Feature**: [specs/005-ai-classroom-research/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items passed. Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify`.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with P1 (evidence-based applications) as MVP foundation
- All 15 functional requirements are testable without implementation details
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., readability scores, citation counts, specific metrics)
- Scope clearly excludes higher education, vendor endorsements, and technical implementation guides
- Edge cases address research gaps and context variation
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions

**No Issues Found**: Specification meets all quality criteria for planning phase.
