  "assumptions_and_caveats": "ROI calculation uses teacher hourly rate of $40. Benefits assume 39% reduction in lesson planning time across 25 teachers (baseline 10.5 hrs/week for differentiated instruction). ITS implementation requires higher upfront investment in training and curriculum alignment compared to automated grading. Success highly dependent on implementation fidelity - meta-analyses show high variability across implementations. Does not quantify substantial student outcome improvements (d=0.47-0.52) in monetary terms. Time savings may vary significantly by teacher experience and subject area. Requires sustained use over time to realize full benefits."
