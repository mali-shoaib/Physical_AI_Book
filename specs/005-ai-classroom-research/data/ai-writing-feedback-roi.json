Writing quality improvements: effect size d=0.38, 12-18% improvement in essay scores, 35% more revision drafts, 22% reduction in grammatical errors. AI feedback allows hybrid model where teachers focus on higher-order concerns (content, organization, argumentation) while AI handles grammar and mechanics. Particularly beneficial for struggling writers and ELLs (effect size 40% larger). Equity benefit: Immediate feedback for all students, closing feedback gap in under-resourced schools."

  "assumptions_and_caveats": "ROI calculation uses teacher hourly rate of $40. Benefits assume 48% reduction in writing feedback delivery time across 25 teachers (baseline 11.2 hrs/week). Writing feedback is one of the most time-intensive teacher tasks, explaining the high ROI. Success depends on teachers maintaining focus on higher-order feedback while AI handles mechanics. Does not quantify student engagement and writing quality improvements in monetary terms. Time savings assume teachers use AI for formative feedback on drafts; summative assessment feedback may still require full teacher attention. Effectiveness varies by writing genre and student grade level."
