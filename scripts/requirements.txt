# Python dependencies for validation scripts
# These are minimal dependencies for linting and validation only
# ROS 2 dependencies are not included (expected to be in separate environment)

# Markdown linting (optional, for npm script)
# Install with: npm install -g markdownlint-cli

# Python validation - all scripts use only standard library
# No additional packages required for basic validation

# Optional: Enhanced validation tools
# pyyaml>=6.0  # For YAML frontmatter validation (future enhancement)
# jsonschema>=4.0  # For schema validation (future enhancement)
